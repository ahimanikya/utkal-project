# Investment in Odisha — domestic and foreign capital

## The current editorial focus

**Investment in Odisha — domestic and foreign capital, from commitment to operation.** The user replaced the standalone FDI headline track on 27 September 2026. Present values in ₹ crore or ₹ lakh crore, with stage and period beside every number. The [saved FDI series](fdi.md) remains a narrow reference, not the weekly headline.

## A supported starting point

| Measure | Period | Officially reported amount | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 80 industrial projects described as implemented | 2025 | ₹1.75 lakh crore | Investment associated with reported implementation; cash-spend definition not established |
| 244 approved industrial projects | 2025 | ₹5.66 lakh crore | Estimated project budgets; approval does not establish expenditure |

These two values come from section 5.1.3 of the full survey's official indexed passage.[^investment-survey-full-2026] The executive summary gives less precise versions, ₹1.7 lakh crore and ₹5.6 lakh crore. Preserve both publication variants rather than treating their difference as new investment.[^investment-survey-summary-2026]

The summary also records ₹15.1 lakh crore of commitments across 275 MoUs at listed 2025 investor events, and ₹65,010 crore of state capital outlay in FY2025–26 budget estimates. These are separate coverage and status measures.[^investment-survey-summary-2026]

## What we can say

**“Odisha reports ₹1.75 lakh crore in investment across 80 industrial projects implemented in 2025.”** Attribute this to the Economic Survey and retain its implementation terminology. This is stronger evidence than an intent-only headline, but it is not an audited statewide total of cash spent or proof that every plant is operating.

The figures do not supply a domestic/foreign funding split. They are a broader industrial-investment starting point that is not restricted to the DPIIT foreign-equity series. Do not label their sum as total domestic plus foreign investment.

## Tracker design

Maintain three reader-facing views: **investment delivered**, **projects progressing**, and **future commitments**. Put an actual expenditure figure in the first view only when source scope and period support it. Keep reported implementation with its source label until commissioning or expenditure is established.

For each project capture a stable project ID, promoter, district, sector, ownership/funding origin when documented, phase, stage date, announced/approved cost, cumulative and period spending if disclosed, commissioned capacity and employment status. Unknown fields remain unknown. Match repeated announcements and expansion phases before aggregation.

Track private businesses, public-sector enterprises and government capital outlay separately. Domestic/foreign/mixed ownership and public/private ownership are different classifications. Corporate headquarters, promoter nationality or a foreign brand name do not by themselves measure how a project was financed.

Do not add MoUs, approved costs and implemented-project amounts: the same projects may appear in multiple stages. Do not add FDI flows to project costs, or cumulative capital stock to annual spending. Exclude growth/conversion rates until comparison coverage and project cohorts match. A comprehensive statewide realised investment total has not yet been established.

## Next evidence to obtain

IPICOL and Industries Department project-level implementation definitions and lists; company annual reports/exchange filings with Odisha-specific capital expenditure; commissioning evidence; Finance Accounts and budget actuals for public capital outlay; comparable five/ten-year series. Use successive releases to build evidence, not to inflate the same project's total.

## A completed purchase is not the same as a newly built factory

**IMFA reports ₹707.27 crore paid to Tata Steel for the acquired Kalinganagar plant.** This is a useful project-linked payment record for FY2025–26. It records an existing asset changing hands; it cannot be presented as ₹707.27 crore spent building new productive capacity in Odisha. [Buyer annual report, printed p.17 / PDF p.10](https://www.imfa.in/api/pdf/IMFAAnnualReportFY2526.pdf/IMFA_Annual_Report_FY_2526_10bbee90f9.pdf).

Three identities prevent the place name “Kalinganagar” from collapsing different projects into one:

| Identity | Evidence and date | What stays unknown |
|---|---|---|
| Acquired plant, KNR2 | Agreement 4 November 2025; completed 27 February 2026; four furnaces restarted and some material dispatched in March 2026 | Exact March output, current operation and jobs created |
| KNR2 fifth furnace | Ministry annexure 4 September 2026: proposed 33-MVA furnace not implemented | Actual construction spending and commissioning |
| Greenfield plant, KNR1 | Directors report 27 May 2026: advanced construction; June/September pre-commissioning targets | Observed commissioning and project-specific cash spent |

[Tata Steel’s agreement](https://www.tatasteel.com/media/24981/tata-steel-limited-press-release.pdf) and [completion disclosure](https://www.tatasteel.com/media/25494/bsense.pdf) concern the same transaction. They are stage history, not two flows. The buyer’s report identifies the acquired plant as KNR2 and the greenfield plant as KNR1; the [ministry clearance transfer](https://www.imfa.in/api/pdf/IA_OR_IND1_04092026.pdf/IA_OR_IND_1_04092026_a1432f31b5.pdf) limits the implemented scope to the four existing furnaces. Same publisher repeated through different releases is one reporting lineage.

### Reconcile the money before adding anything

The completed transfer’s **₹610 crore base consideration excludes GST and working capital**. Buyer note 45(vi) separately records **₹25.03 crore net working capital assumed, excluding GST**. The ₹707.27 crore payment footnote has a broader stated amount, but the inspected passages do not provide a complete bridge. These are overlapping descriptions/components of one acquisition: do not add them or invent a tax explanation for their difference. [Note 45(vi), printed p.198 / PDF p.101](https://www.imfa.in/api/pdf/IMFAAnnualReportFY2526.pdf/IMFA_Annual_Report_FY_2526_10bbee90f9.pdf).

The Directors’ Report says the acquisition was funded entirely from internal accruals. That documents the immediate funding mechanism; it does not establish a domestic/foreign percentage of the company’s underlying capital. Company-wide capital work in progress covers several projects and is a balance at a date, not this plant’s annual cash expenditure.

The acquired four furnaces represent 100,000 tonnes/year of reported capacity; the separate fifth furnace’s 50,000 tonnes/year remains a plan in the captured evidence. KNR1’s 100,000 tonnes/year also remains planned capacity here. Capacity is not output, and elapsed target dates do not prove completion. These are dated historical observations, not a claim that October operating status was checked.

The [IMFA company record](../economy/company-imfa.md) supplies the wider production, workforce and mining context. The [company-investment page](../statistics/company-investment.md) explains why company-level spending cannot simply become an Odisha total. These are contextual relationships, not proof of investment causation or financial returns.

Connects the named asset transfer to existing production and workforce evidence; those measures remain separate.

Distinguishes a project-linked acquisition payment from company-wide capital expenditure.
